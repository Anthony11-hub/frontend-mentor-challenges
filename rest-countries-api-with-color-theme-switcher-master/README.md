## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I gained valuable insights from this challenge. Initially, I was uncertain about how CSS Grid functions, but with the help of various YouTube resources, I acquired the skills to effectively navigate CSS Grid. Additionally, I learned how to retrieve data and present it on the frontend. Having previously worked on a project involving an API, I applied similar logic to address the requirements of this challenge.

Furthermore, I discovered the impressive capabilities of local storage, which, with a 5MB capacity, allows for a multitude of functionalities. I successfully employed local storage to implement the dark mode/light mode switch feature. In summary, this challenge provided me with a wealth of knowledge and new skills.

### Continued development

I will continue working on css grid layouts and also continue leveraging local storage more in future projects.
