- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned a little bit about how Flexbox works and how it differs from CSS Grid.

### Continued development

I will continue practicing by building projects on Frontend Mentor to deepen my understanding of CSS. I'm also looking forward to getting into Tailwind CSS later on, especially when I start relearning React.
