- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned more about how Flexbox works.

### Continued development

I will continue practicing by building projects on Frontend Mentor to deepen my understanding of CSS. I'm also looking forward to getting into Tailwind CSS later on, especially when I start relearning React.

### Useful resources

- [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - Helped me understand how to align the svg images with their p tag elements.
